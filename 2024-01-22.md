# dart mode 
## debug mode 
- your application will not be complie to binary file 
- your application is not forcus on the application but on the convience in development 

## release mode 
- in this relase mode you will get a binary file exe 

# OPP in dart 
- conside version : mean the shorter verison of the constructor 
```
mean that you can just write 
Social(this.id  , this.name , this.url)  ; 

instead of 
Social( int id , String name ,  String url)  ;

void main()
{
Social(this.id , this.name , this.url) ; 
}

```

- when declaring student object you need to provide the name for each paremeter 
```
class Student{ 
int id ; 
String name ;
int age ;
List<Social> socials = [ ] ; 
Student({this.id, this.name , this.age})
}

void main()
{
Student(id : 1 ,name:'John') ; 
}

```
- if you not provide the default value it will lead to error when providing name key word 

```
void main()
{
var s = Social(1,  'FACEBOOK', 'url')
Student(id : 1 ,name:'John') ; 

print(s) ;
}
 
```
- you need to overide the string method in the social class with a  if not then it will print out the default string 
```
void main()
{
var s1 = Social(1,  'FACEBOOK', 'url')
Student(id : 1 ,name:'John') ; 
var s2 = Social(1,  'FACEBOOK', 'url')
print(s) ;
s1=s2  ; 
}
 
```

- this will product an error so you need  to overide the comparision object 


```
bool operator == (Object other)
{ 
if (other is Social )
{ return this.id == other.id &&  this.name ==name  , this.url == other.url  }
}
```

# Flutter 
- the dart program will be compile to the target environment 
- hot reloading make it so that you can see the afect right awalys without having to stope 
- flexible mean you can create any ui element  
	- the button on different platform is different but on flutter their design is the same 
- you are only touching the dart programming , in just one code bases 
- when you run on different devices the app will look the same on that devices 
- web app , not all feature that are on mobile are not on web  
	- you create an app that scan qr on the app you cannot do that on the web 
## folder in flutter API 
### there is two different folder in android and ios  
- these folder require the application to behave differently for each system 
## lib folder 
- you can click on vstudio the bottom blue bar that have the macos folder 
- in android devices you need to download the usb driver , your phone will be then recordnize by the usb driver 
#  design  in application 
- there are two type of theme in flutter Material design + cupertino design 
-  Material design  is for andorid application  , cupertino design is for ios application 
- in most documentation they used Material design 
hinh 1 
these are all the thing in matterial 
- what do you call all thing like button , check box  in android , it is call `view` 
- `view` is the parent of all interface element in andord 
- in flutter the parent class of all ui component is call `widget` 
- `widget` bulding complexing thing form simple ui application like lego 
```
void main()
{
var myStyle = TextStyle(
fontSize :20 , 
coor : color.green  , 
)
};
var text =Text (
'welcome to flutter' , 
myStyle 
)
```
- text is a stylable widget 
- textstyle is not a stylable widget 
- we need a runApp function , in the runApp function there is a widget , a widget can be a single text or the whole application screan 
- scaffold is the sekeleton mean that main section 
- the wigdet will have uppercase while the properties will have lower can 


- when you write an flutter application if you write save it will save and format the code you need to add `),` for each section of the code you add 
	- an example of this is a the appbar ,body and floating action button , each of these is widget in the application 
	- flutter have a lot of widget 
	- widget in a stack  

# stateless and stateful 
stateless will not change 
statefull will change : textbox is a statefull when you click a checkbox it will change 
	- statefull contain interstate that can be change so you need to manage it  
# stateless 
you need to decare a class extending form stateless , when you create a class you are creating your own user interface 
there are three of the most commonly used button text oriantaed 
stateful is when you want to change the initialize object value 
stateless is when you want  to create a new object and change it value without having to change the object
# button 
outline button 

# text flied 
this is the place to collect information from the user
