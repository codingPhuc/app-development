## Cross-platform mobile apps development introduction. 

- The ideal of a cross platform application is to develop one code base instead of multiple when building an app , this code bases can work on multiple mobile application 
- The programming language , the complexity of the development process , the availability of a software development kit (SDK) and the viability of the mobile apps created are heavily dependent on which cross platform framework is chosen  
- Flutter and React Native are by far the most popular cross-platform framework 
## Cross-platform vs native app development.  
- Native application mean building the application form scratch using platform specific programming languages , the beauty of building native apps is that the development process allows custom software development to leverage the full capabilities of the chosen mobile platform 
- Cross platform application on the other hand make cost low by maintaining only one platform 
- In the past Cross platform application was not able to compete with native application due to UI and slow speed 
- today due to google investment into flutter and Facebook into React Native app development have been steam line 
- 
## Pros and cons of cross-platform app development.  
## Cost Efficiency 
- small company that does not have budget can develop the app in cross platform to get large amount of customer before rebuilding in native for better experience 
- the team size is smaller 
## Time Efficiency 
- Native are more costly and demanding causing a larger waste of time 
- Team can focus on only one code base 
- Time is save more when developing cross platform
## Bigger market 
- it is no  secret that developing an application in multiple platform will have a wider user bases 
## Code Consistency 
- creating a code base on one language can make delay happen way less and create a more manageable future growth
