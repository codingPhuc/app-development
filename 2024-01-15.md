question : what do you mean by dart sdk is a part of sdk of flutter 



## dart programming 
- you can used dart programming for front end and  back end 
- dart is the programming languge for fulter application 
- fullter is a framwork comprising two element 
hinh 1 
- the flutter frame work 
- the flutter sdk (software development kit )
- when running the application in a real devices you can
- testing you can run multiple devices at the sametime , a computer that should be used is a type that support 2gb ram , 
- The flutter SDK includes the fill Dart SDK , and has Dart dart command line in it bin folder 
- the flutter sdk include the full dart sdk and has dart dart command line in its bin folder 

# tool you need for flutter 
- Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment 
	- window powershell 5.0 or newer (this )
## check installation result 
- flutter doctor 
	- this command will run everything 
```
// this is where your main application will start 
void main()
{
print("hello world ")
}
```

to run the application go to the main folder where amin.js is the file containing the above source code 

```

```
when you run it like this no binary output is created ,  because we run it in debug mode 
there are two type of complie : 
- AOT (Ahead Of Time) complier 
- JIT (Just In Time) 
the resone for this is because the cretator of the language  want to make development 
JIT complie can run but the application is not fast , it is easy to make change while reload you do not need to stop the app when making the change 
AOT on the other hand is more convience for user it run faster 


most commonly used data type in dart 
- String : for storing text value 
- int for storing integer value 
- double for foalting point value 
- num for storing any types of number  
- bool for storing true or false value 
- var for storing any value 


string have different type parameter , some string have single quout some string have double quout some string have more """"


properties of string : 
- code unit 
- isemtpty 
- isnotempty 
- length 
method of string : 
- tolowerCase() : convert all characters in this string to lowercase
- toUpperCase() : Converts all characters in this string to uppercase
- trim
- compareTo
- replaceALl
- split
- toString
- substring
- codeUnitAt

## null stafty 
- In Dart , variales and fields are non-nullable by default , which mean that they cannot have a value null unless you explicitly allow it 
- in null safety , variables cannot be null unless you explicitly specify that they can 
```
void main()
{
int a1 =20   ; 
int a2 = null ; // complie error 
}
```
- the above code can be wrote in java but cannot be in dart 
- sometime in java it can cause a null pointer exception 
```
processName(string name)
{
// do something 
}

void main()
{
String name = 'Nguyen ming tuan';
print(processName(name)) ; 
print(processName(null)); // this is not posible in dart
}
``` 


- To specify that a variable can be null , you add a question mark to the type in variable declaration 

```
void main()
{
	String? name = 'Nguyen Minh TUan ' ; 
	print (name )
	name = null  ; 
	print (name)// allow 
}
```

some mark datatype with question 
- int? 
-  double? 
- bool?
- String?
- Point?
- Student?
### working with nullable types 
- the ideal of null safty is to prevent null pointer exception 
- you can only add null if you are able to force it 
- it will also warn you when a variable that is null activate in a function 
- the complie will also warn you if you used a null variable 
```
void main()
{
String? message ; 
print(message.lenght)  ;
}
```
we cannot print the value of message string with it corresponding null value 
sollution 
- you have to put the statement inside if check or use the ? . operator before accessing properties of nullable object 

```
String? message ; 
if(message == null)
	print('Can not get length of a null string ') ;  
else 
	print(message.length )
```
- another solution is to used the ? mark before execution 
```
void main()
{
String? message ; 
print(message?.lenght) ;
}
```
- if you also used it for situtation in which the method used is not print 
```
void main()
{
String password = "1234567" ; 
if(password?.length >6) 
{
print('Password is valid) ; 

}
else 
{
print('password is not valid')
}
}
```
- you can either used another if statement  that encapsulate the password?.length 
- you can used the build in if that can be write using 1 question mark (password?.lenght ?? 0)
- you can used a ! mark (password!.length > 6) this will cause a crack becaue you ensure  the complie that it would not be null 


## function parameter in Dart 
```
void printInfo( String name , String gender , [String title ="sir/myam])
{
print("Hello $title $anme your gender is $gender" ) ; 
}

```
- int this function the arguemnt inside the [] mean that the variable does not matter 

```
void printInfo({string name = '' , String gender = 'Male'})
{
print("hello $name your gender is $gender.") ; 
}
void main()
{
printINfo(gender : "Male" , name : "John") ; 
printInfo(gender : "Site" , gender : "Female" ) ; 
}
```
- in this cases you need to sepcify what type of value to pass in one the {} is used with an argument in the method if there is no value pass into the parameter it will used the default one 

```
void main()
{
const fruits = ["Apple" , "Mango" , "Banana" , "Orange] ; 
fruits.forEach(fruit)
{

}
}
```
- the above is a lambda function 
- if you want to store multiple values in the same variable , you can use List. List in dart is similar to array 
```
list<string>
list<int>
// dynamic value can have nay value form array to list 
var dy = [10, 12 ,"name"]
```
- you can also change the value of aliit by using listname[index] = value
